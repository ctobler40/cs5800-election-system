        The purposes for which we may process personal information will vary depending upon the circumstances.
        We may also aggregate and and/or anonymize personal information and analyze that information for statistical or any other purposes permitted by law. When we do so, we take reasonable precautions to ensure the information cannot be associated with an identifiable user and we maintain and use the information in deidentified form, except that may we attempt to reidentify such information to determine whether our deidentification processes satisfy applicable legal requirements. After being deidentified, the information is no longer personal information and is not subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>Sources of personal information</h2>
        <p>
        We collect personal information directly from users when you interact with us. We also collect personal information from vendors and third parties when they provide information to us. For example, we may receive names and addresses of registered voters from other organizations. We also collect personal information from vendors and third-party providers of cookies and other tracking technologies used on our Services.
        </p>
        <h2>How we disclose personal information</h2>
        <p>
        We disclose the categories of personal information listed in this Privacy Policy as detailed below:

Third Party Sites and Plugins: If you register to vote, donate to Vote.org, check your registration status, request an absentee ballot, or sign up for election reminders through an embedded version of Vote.org’s tools on a third party partner’s website, any information you provide in doing so may be made available to the third party partner through whose site you accessed Vote.org’s tools.
Advertisers: Third-party cookies, as described in “Cookies and data tracking” are shared with third-party vendors for advertising purposes, including Google, which will be shown on other sites on the internet. In some cases, those third-party vendors may decide which ads to show you based on your prior visits to the Site. If you prefer to opt out of the use of these third-party cookies on the Site, you can do so by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page.
Local or State Municipalities: After you mail in or electronically submit your voter registration application form to local or state election officials, it generally becomes a matter of public record from your state of residence. This means it will be available for inspection and use by candidates for public office and their campaign organizations as well as by others who satisfy the requirements of the State law governing its use.
Other Services providers and Advisors: We may share your personal information to third parties that support our IT, perform data analytics and optimization, send communications to our users, or provide us with legal or financial advice and help us deliver our Services to you.
Government, Regulators, and Law Enforcement: Vote.org will challenge any attempt to gain access to the information you give us by government agencies or private organizations. In the unlikely event that we are required by law to disclose any of your information we will do our best to contact you first so that you may have the opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will also independently object to any requests for access to information about users of our Site that we believe to be improper.
When sharing information with third parties, we try to de-identify any such information, to further protect your personal information but complete de-identification may not be possible and personal information may be shared with third parties, as described above.
        </p>
        <h2>Security and retention</h2>
        <p>
        Vote.org uses industry-standard security measures to protect the information collected by this Site, and to authenticate your identity or the identity of an agent authorized by you when exercising a data right described above, but we cannot guarantee complete security.

We retain personal information for the period reasonably necessary to provide our services to you, support our reasonable business operational purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and ensure compliance with applicable law.
        </p>
